## 🌍 Key Insights

- Out of **227 countries** analyzed:
  - **95 countries** experienced a **loss in forest area**
  - **87 countries** saw a **gain in forest cover**
  - **45 countries** showed **no significant change**
- The highest deforestation trend (by percentage) was recorded for **Egypt** in the dataset (**-100%**).  
  > ⚠️ *Note: This value likely results from a very small initial forest area and rounding in the dataset—not total forest loss. According to independent sources, Egypt's actual forest area declined from approximately 592 km² in 2000 to 450 km² in 2020, a net decrease of about 24%.*

- **Guernsey** recorded the **highest reforestation trend**, with an **86.20% increase** in forest cover.
